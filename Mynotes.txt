NOTES:

.parse -> convert JSON string to JavaScript Object
-----------
Synchronus -> Every line of code run one after another without runnig something else in background.
Asynchronus -> Allow to keep run the code while waiting/processing something in background. 
-----------

setTimeout(() => {
                                  *Require a function and a timing (,2000)
}, 2000)

--------------

call stack -> Is the order of how code run, start with main() and stacks all calls and actions

setTimeout -> Is a nodeAPI, so when we call it our call stack stack it and move it on nodeAPI

callback Queue -> This is a staging location where once the timer meet his condition wait to be integrated in the call stack, call stack need to be free

callback -> Is a function that we provide to another function that we can call later

----------------

- Working with setTimeout and callback
    Logic without timer:

    const add = (a,b, callback) => {
        callback (a + b);
    }


    add (1,4(sum) => {
        console.log(sum)
    })


    Logic with timer: 

    const add = (a,b, callback) => {
        setTimeout(() ={
            callback(a + b);
        }, 2000)
    }


-------------------

nodemon -> allow to keep the server run also if keep making changes on the code

nodemon src/app.js -e js,hbs -> Extension to files to watch

Installation not global:
1. npm install --save-dev nodemon
2. npx nodemon src/app.js (to run it locally)


--------------------

http://localhost:3000/products?search=NewYork&rating=4.7

?
search= 
&=

console.log(req.query) -> Allows me to print on the terminal the result
{ search: 'NewYork', rating: '4.7' }


console.log(req.query.search) -> Allow me to grab the result of search 


------------------

npm install --save -dev browser -sync -> Allow me to see changes on styling without keep refreshing having my node runnig too

Using: npm run backend (1 terminal)
npm run frontend (2 terminal)

npm cors -> necessary
